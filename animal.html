  <p>This is the greatest dog all time. This dog can take your girl in an instant. HIs power level is over 9000. His breath made the dinosaurs extinct. He red like the blood of his haters.
    He single handedly ended slavery. He played college football in high school. By the time you're reading he had already solved world hunger. He beat Usain Bolt by walking. Even Ash Ketchem
    couldn't catch him. Take notes, because this is what peak performance looks like.
